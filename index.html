        Model United Nations is a model or simulation of the United Nations General Assembly and other multilateral bodies, is also known as Model UN or MUN, is a conference which involves extra-curricular activities in which students typically role-play delegates to the United Nations and simulate UN committees. Students play the role of delegates from different countries and attempt to solve real-world issues like drafting resolutions, delivering speeches, negotiating with allies or resolving conflicts. It involves substantial researching, public speaking, debating, and writing skills, as well as critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership abilities. Aim of the MUN is to create an awareness of global issues among youth and give them a chance to deliver solutions to existing world problems.

    <div class="Details">
    <p>UNHRC (The United Nations Human Right Council) withholds the responsibility to ensure and strengthen the promotion and protection of human rights on a global scale, as well as to address cases of human rights infringements and make recommendations upon them. It was established in 2006 with 47 member states.</p>

    <p >An ardent MUNer from the Odisha circuit, Mr. Sarbanga Mishra is pursuing his final year of bachelor's degree at Christ University, Bangalore. A student of journalism himself, he is no stranger to global affairs and journalistic skills. As a delegate, Mr. Mishra has attended numerous Model United Nations conferences and has bagged more than 40 Best Delegate awards, most of which are from prestigious institutions of India. He strongly believes that every good executive board member must be a quality delegate first as that clearly gives one a strong insight into MUNs. Being part of the Indian MUNing circuit since 2014, he has chaired numerous institutional MUN conferences based in sundry circuits of India and is well known for being an executive board member who has mastered the technicalities of MUNs, which adds to his credibility as well as impeccable MUNing skills. We believe that he not only brings to the table a plethora of knowledge but also an ability to moderate committees to the best of his abilities, with utmost rectitude. Other than being an MUNer, he is an academician who has authored various research papers and bagged best research paper awards from reputed institutions of India. He's also a well known debater, spoken poet, national level martial artist, sterling wordsmith, enthusiastic chess player and published writer. Furthermore, he takes keen interest in International law and International relations. He claims that reading and researching would always be his "metaphorical crushes".</p>

        <p>ECOSOC (The United Nations Economic and Social Council) is dedicated to establishing global frameworks that promote a higher standard of living. Being established by the United Nations Charter in 1945 and consisting of 54 member states, ECOSOC is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations. The committee is responsible for finding solutions to various international economic, social, and environmental issues. Its role in encouraging the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms was also remarkable.</p>
    
        <p >A zugzwang breaker, Shouvonik Bose entered the halls of MUNs in 2018. From his first MUN with a "Best Newcomer" award to chairing International MUNs, the exponential growth in his MUN career is matched only with his love for argumentative debate and heated discussions about anything and everything under the sun. Revering logic, facts and unique opinions, he loves to play the devil's advocate where he will force you to your wit's end. Graduating in 2022 with B. Tech in Computer Science, his knowledge, experience, and opinions are ever evolving. MUNs, in his opinion, is a brilliant way to hone strategic foresight and employ rational thinking in one's day to day life and build towards a sustainable future.</p>
